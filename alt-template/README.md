# Alternate Template #

This directory contains an alternate version of the network files in the parent directory.
This was derived from the World Bank's Open Data Toolkit. They are very similar except that
this variant implements responsive theming but is only available in English. Since
this was derived post hoc from the toolkit site there are plenty of vestigial site-specific
elements, particularly in the CSS files, which may affect portability, but I've tried to
include the necessary original source files (in SASS) to help as much as possible.
